### Malaria Detection: A Deep Learning Approach
Applied several Deep Learning techniques to build different classification models capable of supporting malaria diagnosis by predicting infection from microscopy images of parasitized red blood cells. The models rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that classify cell image samples as parasitized or uninfected.
